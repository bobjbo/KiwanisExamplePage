            <div class="centered-text-container">
                When service clubs are chartered, they are not automatically formed as a 501(c)3
                charity. There are various foundations, which are 501(c)3 charities, that our club
                is associated with or have access to for donation/charity purposes.

            <h1>CSH KIWANIS FOUNDATION</h1>

            <div class="centered-text-container">
                This is our club’s own 501(c)3 foundation. It is completely separate from our
                administrative funds. When we have a fundraiser, this is where the money goes
                and our contributions to organizations come from this fund.

                Kiwanis club in Region 4, which does not have their own 501(c)3 foundation. The
                Region 4 Trustee and the Division 6, 7, 8 and 9 Lt. Governors oversee the
                foundation.

                Scholarship Fund in 1960. It has evolved over the years to the Earl Collins
                Foundation and benefits the MO ARK district. The Earl Collins Foundation awards
